Reflecting on a future of the book, alongside its history, I would like to imagine several
possible alternatives to electronic reading as we know it today. The terms "platform" and
"format" will guide a speculative exploration through an archive of "dead" literary
technologies: micrographic prints, computexts, hypercards, and ePUBs. Our path will traverse
not only distant textual materialities, but also their associated practices, interfaces, and
affordances. The way in which a book's spine or a reading chair realign the positions of the
back, eye, and hand suggests another type of structuring when reading electronically, within
environments made of polymer, rare metal, and liquid crystal. How does one mould the human body
to fit such alien materials?  Can a book be worn like an overcoat?  What if a text came in the
form of a pill or an implant? The history of the electronic book ultimately attests to the
process of trans-mediation, contested at the boundary of hardware---paper and silicon---and
software---text, body, and code.
