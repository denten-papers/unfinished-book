To imagine a possible future of the book, in light of its pasts, I would like to present not so
much a final shape or an object, but rather a sketch---a roadmap---for the study of objects
that very much resemble books, yet require a theoretical reconfiguration so as to appear to the
critical gaze in their full complexity and sheer alien difference to the familiar---still not
without their mystery---constellations made of paper and ink. This sketch will be an
opportunity to introduce several terms borrowed from the fields of media studies and computer
science, terms that should equip us to better understand those areas of the map already
explored and those still in need of description, pathfinding, and analysis. The interlaced
media archaeology of electronic books will serve to ground theoretical principles in observed
practice.

Key to this understanding is a presupposition shared by most book historians, textual critics,
and media scholars, which manifests in the attention to the social and material contexts of
ideational content, in light of which a book represents, at once, a metaphysical construct of
the mind, a physical object, and a practice of reading. Matter envelops symbol to produce a
specifically instantiated thing. Therefore, a reader's ability to reach anything like content
---a work of art---is circumscribed by the medium within which such content is embedded---an
object of art---further contained by the social structures that once again mediate and are
mediated by their symbolic and technological containments.

A reader's inability to "grasp the shadowy and fantasmal form of the book" in its entirety, "to
hold it fast, to turn it over and survey it at leisure" [@lubbock, 1] stems from the
fundamental incompatibilities between the innermost symbolic, purely discursive, realms and the
outermost, corporeal, and purely embodied techniques of comprehension: the first, limited by
the expressive possibilities of language and the second by the cognitive and perceptual
mechanics of the human body. Techniques of mediation between the two are therefore neither
wholly determinate nor wholly socially constructed. Rather, they develop through a series of
negotiated protocols, by which specific interfaces or channels of transmission develop between
disparate symbolisms and physicalities. The trans-mediation of mind-things into paper and ink
things entails the corresponding trans-figuration of content, the latter in the simple sense of
that which is being contained. A line of reasoning resembles a line on a page or a paragraph,
although the two do not transpose perfectly. The structure of thoughts in the abstract---their
transcendent form---and the structure of words on a page---their immanent format---meet at the
interface of two incompatible systems, the symbolic and biological. An interface enables the
compatibility between physically heterotopic systems at the point of contact. In this way, the
tail end of a fork is molded to conform to the hand and begins to resemble a hand, bearing the
imprint of a palm and its digits. The hand for its part becomes more fork-like in the grasping
of the tool. Similarly, the interface of a digital book is that physical adaptation that allows
for the physical exchange between between mind and symbol, reshaping both in the process of
transmission.

The electronic book came into being in multiple guises, one of the earliest being a part of the
PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations), a computer controlled teaching
system, implemented at the University of Illinois, Urbana in the 1960s. PLATO's history as an
educational tool and a proto-internet information sharing network is well explored by
historians such as Joy Lisi Rinkin, in her ground-breaking *People's History of Computing in
the United States* (Harvard University Press, 2018). Less known is PLATO's original coinage of
the "electronic book," consisting of a "bank of slides," of the type usually "found in a
textbook or in class notes," but "prestored in an electronic slide selector" that could be
"shared by all the students," who were also able to "view same or different slides
simultaneously [...] by connecting electronically to the student's television display"
[@bitzer_uses_1966, 36; @rinkin, 171]. The system was capable of storing 122 such slides, and
to provide access to them in an arbitrary order in less than a microsecond [@bitzer_uses_1966,
36]. In a parallel development circa 1962, the US National Science Foundation announced "a new
publishing program of electronic 'books' contained on magnetic tape." Developed by
Documentation, Inc., a Washington D.C. firm, these so-called "computexts" were meant to
facilitate "high-speed computer searches in readable English." "An Electronic Index to Chemical
Patents" was to be the first title issued to take advantage of that capability. "The electronic
index will cover 150,000 patents issued over the last 17-years," read the report, "the set of
tapes covering this data can be contained in only one cubic foot of storage space"
[@national_science_foundation_electronic_1962, 4].

Both of these devices were enabled by the simultaneous maturing of three technologies: magnetic
tape storage, cathode ray tube (CRT) television, and the typewriter. As a storage medium, tape
offered a number of advantages over its predecessors. It was, as the documents note, more
portable than paper, punch cards, or magnetic drums. It lasted longer than other mechanized
forms of storage, because electro-magnetic reading and writing devices made light contact with
the tape---unlike, for example, punch-card systems, where the mechanism had to physically
protrude through the media in order to read and write. Unlike hole-punches or ink, magnetic
polarities were easily reversible, making for a re-writable medium, in which errors of
transcription could be immediately reversed. However, magnetic tape had one major weakness, in
that it denied plain readability, electromagnetic inscription being invisible to the human eye.
The increasing commercialization of CRT television displays in the 1960s made possible a
restoration of human vision. Editing tapes directly with magnets or scissors was also obviously
impractical. An instrument equivalent of a pen was needed to facilitate revision. Coupled with
this system, a typewriter restored our tactile ability to edit stored inscriptions. In concert,
tube, tape, and typewriter could approximate the affordances of ink and paper, creating a
facsimile of page, and eventually a book.

In the historically contingent agglomeration of these three specific technologies we observe
the development of a bridge-like structure, expanding to span the gap between media and human
sensory organs. Where minds and ideas are hosted by bodies and brains, texts, and inscriptions
are hosted by increasingly more remote physicalites such as solid state drives (SSDs) and
liquid crystal displays (LCDs). The different systems store information in radically different
formats: the brain, as a lattice of connected neurons, books, in chapters and paragraphs, and
SSDs in polarized configurations of floating gates. Despite these first-order material
differences, we are able to recognize similarities across media in content conceived in purely
symbolic, second-order structural terms. The paragraphs of Virginia's Wolf's *To the
Lighthouse* follow the same sequence on paper and on screen, although on a hard drive, they
might be stored in a completely non-sequential, fragmented patches of data (and that in
contrast to the orderly procession of paragraphs on a page). Books "take shape in the mind of
the reader," where "they are recreated and set up where the mind's eye can rest on them." A
book can never be embodied fully as a mental structure in other words, the interpretive gaze
necessarily falls on "certain fragments of the book which the author wrote, the rest of it
having ceased to exist for us" [@lubbock, 3]. Lubbock struggles conceptually by overloading the
concept of the book to indicate at once mental and physical structures, and later terminates
his inquiry stopping just short of media studies: "if only there were one single tangible and
measurable fact about the book---if it could be weighed like a statute, say, or measured like a
picture---it would support a world of shadows" [@lubbock, 274]. But the book does exist
tangibly on paper and in mind, although in different formats. To traverse the two one need to
disambiguate the meaning of the book in the sense of a mental from that in the sense of a
physical structure, and further to attend to the mechanisms of transposition between divergent
media.

The traversal between such first- and second plus-order structures follows strict and often
rigidly defined conventions that specify the exact placement of abstracted units, constituting
the format of the medium-symbol integration. Consider the popular EPUB format, which has its
roots in the Open Bookâ„¢ Publication Structure (OEBPS). According to the Library of Congress
records, the format was created in 1999 by the Open eBook Authoring Group, that consisted of
"over 25 individuals from organizations participating in the Open eBook initiative, launched in
October 1998 [...] convened and facilitated by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and
Technology.)" We learn also that the Authoring Group "included participants representing all
aspects of the electronic publishing industry, and was open to any interested individual or
organization." The document begins with a statement of the group's purpose and scope: "to
provide a specification for representing the content of electronic books" and "to give content
providers [...] minimal and common guidelines which ensure fidelity, accuracy, accessibility,
and presentation of electronic content over various electronic book platforms" [@oebps, 1]. The
concern with "various electronic book platforms," acknowledges the difficulty of describing
document structure under the conditions where the exact dimensions of the medium are not known
in advance. The Open Book could have been displayed on devices large and small, in full color
or monochrome, or on those devices providing "mainly audio or tactile interfaces" [@oebps, 23].
The media agnostic nature of the format necessitated an abstracted style layer, expressed in
HTML/XML and CSS markup schemas, which would describe textual elements such as footnotes and
titles in relative terms such as left, right, top, bottom, or center. In addition to these
positional elements, the format specified social metadata, for example "creator" and
"contributor" types, including subtypes such as annotator, book producer, collaborator,
illustrator, printer, reviewer, sponsor, and translator among others [@oebps, 15-17].

The trademark symbol in the title of the standard, along with the copyright notice on its front
page, work against the grain of its social claims that emphasize the open, participatory nature
of the endeavour. The admixture of content, layout, and para-textual metadata further erodes
the boundaries between strictly formal, content-based abstractions (chapter, paragraph, page)
and social roles encoded into, if not always apparent at the surface of the document. From the
moment of its founding, the "open" ebook format embeds and is embedded within the North
American copyright regime, in a way that would later allow "content creators," "persons or
corporate bodies" to police access to the "reading device," "the physical platform (hardware
and software) on which publications are rendered" [@ops 2.0.1]. The reading platform emerges
from this amalgam of text, technology, bodies, and social structure.

What does a format format then? Following the EPUB example, we observe a series of envelopments
around the notion of content: the first semantic, by which ideational elements are ordered
symbolically (a progression of chapters, for example; second, spatial, by which semantic units
are laid out and oriented in space; third, technological, by which spatial units are rendered
on a device; next, corporeal, by which a reader's body can interface with the device; and
finally the social---political, legal, and economic---by which surface contact between bodies
and devices is negotiated. Formatting---mutual shaping---happens at each linkage in the long
chain of transmediation between symbol and society.

If telepathy were real I would have liked to receive an author's thoughts directly, as a
message without mediation, but I cannot. I must reach through these mediating structures and
not only decode---understand and interpret---the message (all operations at the level of
symbol), but transform it materially back from paper shapes into brain shapes. Given the
stability of a medium, such as the book after Gutenberg press and before the internet, this
process becomes naturalized and conventionally ignored.  Our assumptions about
hermeneutics---the art of interpretation---rest on habituated assumptions about print,
assumptions that cannot be sustained in other media. Problematically for the reader of
electronic books, the physics of computation rest in remote materialities---electromagnetic
polarities and floating gate transistors---not immediately accessible to the human senses.
Software engineers and user interface designers have dealt with this problem by simulating the
affordances of a more familiar medium so as to rely on already habituated intuitions. A reader
of an electronic text may "scroll" or "flip" pages, in tacit understanding that the underlying
motions involve neither scrolling nor flipping, but bitwise operations, the movement of liquid
crystals and polar field effects.

The tactile property of pages guides the eye and the hand in a way to create a cadence of
reading in real time. A reader's ability to read quickly or slowly is similarly limited by the
affordances of page turning. In reading for the plot, a reader can advance to its end in the
manner that a video game player cannot when playing a video game.  Some digital readers can
even be configured to page the book automatically and to measure the duration of the reading
engagement in time units (three hours left in this book) rather than in pages (200 pages left).
Obversely, a page format affects the pacing of narrative, as a system of symbolic order.
Elements of a plot must, for all their variability, fit within the book. Such constraints are
natural, arising from the material particularities of ink and paper---for example, reading a
soggy book in torrential storm conditions cannot be advised---while others are artificially and
conventionally imposed, as is the case with page dimensions or the thickness of paper used in
the production of a book. A container "fits" its content just as it casts the hand and eye into
convenient grasping and gazing gestures. Further, at its outer edge, the imprint of a container
becomes the organizing principle governing the configuration of larger epistemic structures in
which it is embedded. In this way letters shape words, word shape paragraphs, paragraphs pages,
pages books, books shelves, shelves stacks, stacks libraries, libraries the episteme and the
world.

Interfaces determine the affordance of those actions that can be performed in concert between
heterotopic systems. Amidst the universes of hand and fork possibilities, there lies a subset
of actions available only to the combined set. It is not enough to say that a handle affords
grasping, rather, it suggests convenient grasping in a specific way, and conversely, prevents
other ways of grasping made inconvenient and impossible. An interface determines or governs
through its affordances, by spatial arrangement, conforming the hand to the handle and the
handle to the hand. For an archaeologist or a media archaeologist, interfaces bare the traces
of its usage. Knowing nothing about human hands, an alien visitor would reconstruct them by the
shape of our household tools, input devices such as mice and joysticks, and our eating and
writing implements. Further, the affordance of such artifacts would suggest their probable use:
the difference between an axe and an adze, for example, necessitates distinct swinging motions,
optimizing each for differing purposes---one for the cutting and the other for the carving of
wood. But just as it leaves distinct toolmarks in wood, the orientation of the working edge
also exhorts a specific body posture.

By the logic of interfaces and affordances, the shape of a printed book contains a number of
assumptions about the human body, which include minimally sufficient visual acuity and manual
dexterity. Other-abled bodies, those with severe hyperopia for example, must resort to
assistive devices such as reading glasses or magnifying loupes. At the other side of the
interface, the book also shapes content. Literary formats such as the novel or a short story
define their measurements in relation to book objects, manufactured to conventional
specifications. A novel will always be longer than a few pages and shorter than a million, and
often at the some average range between the possible extremes. Micro- or macroscopic novels are
possible, but impractical. Such objects would violate the established mechanisms of access,
storage, and distribution of books, optimized to the equilibrium of convention.

"About This Book shows you additional information about your book the first time you open it."
Four starts at average by 469 readers. A typical time to read 3 hours and 23 pages. I can
"follow" Virginia Woolf's author pages, I am recommended other works by the author and informed
of 583 passages highlight 5,848 times. "And, what was even more exciting, she felt, too, as she
saw Mr Ramsay bearding down and retreating, and Mrs ramsay sitting with James in the windo and
the cloud moving and the tree bending, how life, from bein made up of little separate incidents
which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one
down with it, there, with a dash on the beach" [@woolf, location 626].

The schematic representation of the book which I am attempting to sketch out here emerges in
the technological envelopment of symbolic material, to fuse into a structure that is further
encapsulated with its social context. At the outer limits of the textual universe, book as a
*platform* exists with the complexity of authors, readers, publishers, censors, librarians,
rook sellers, collectors, and book pirates, for whom books serve as tokens of cultural and
financial capital. These platforms usually exist as organic outgrowths of localized ad-hoc
development. A book market in Lahore, Pakistan looks different from that of Chisinau, Moldova
and yet more different from that found in New York, USA.

Because the book is a platform and not merely an For reason, a universal theory of the book,
and consequently a universal theory of literature is impossible. The act of interpretation
holds true for locally contingent agglomerations of signs, media, and bodies, stable only in
specific and limited historical, cultural, and economic contexts.
