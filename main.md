To imagine a possible future of the book, in light of its pasts, I would like to present not so
much a final shape or an object, but rather a sketch---a roadmap---for the study of objects
that very much resemble books, yet require a theoretical reconfiguration so as to appear to the
critical gaze in their full complexity and sheer alien difference to the familiar---still not
without their mystery---constellations made of paper and ink. This sketch will be an
opportunity to introduce several terms borrowed from the fields of media studies and computer
science, terms that should equip us to better understand those areas of the map already
explored and those still in need of description, pathfinding, and analysis. The interleaved
media archaeology of several electronic books will serve to ground theoretical principles in
observed particulates.

Key to this understanding is a presupposition shared by most book historians, philologists,
textual critics, and media scholars, which manifests in the attention to the social and
material contexts of ideational content, in light of which a book represents, at once, a
metaphysical construct of the mind, a physical object, and a practice of reading. Matter
envelops symbol to produce a specifically instantiated thing. Therefore, a reader's ability to
reach anything like content---a work of art---is circumscribed by the medium within which such
content is embedded---an object of art---further contained by the social structures that once
again mediate and are mediated by their symbolic and technological containments.

A reader's inability to "grasp the shadowy and fantasmal form of the book" in its entirety, "to
hold it fast, to turn it over and survey it at leisure" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 1] stems from the
fundamental incompatibilities between the innermost symbolic, discursive, realms and the
outermost, corporeal, and embodied techniques of comprehension: the first, limited by the
expressive possibilities of language and the second by the cognitive and perceptual mechanics
of the human body. Techniques of mediation between the two are thereby neither wholly
determinate nor wholly socially constructed. Rather, they develop through a series of
negotiated protocols, by which specific interfaces or channels of transmission develop between
disparate symbolisms and physicalities. The trans-mediation of mind-things into paper and ink
things entails the corresponding trans-figuration of content, the latter in the simple sense of
that which is being contained. A line of reasoning inhabits a paragraph on a page, although the
two structures do not transpose perfectly. The structure of thoughts in the mind---their
transcendent form---and the structure of lines on a page---their immanent format---meet at the
interface of two incompatible systems, the symbolic and biological. An interface enables the
compatibility between physically heterotopic systems at the point of contact. In this way, the
tail end of a fork is molded to conform to the hand, where it begins to resemble a hand,
bearing the imprint of a palm and its digits. A hand for its part becomes more fork-like in the
grasping of the tool. Similarly, the interface of a digital book is that physical adaptation
that allows for the physical exchange between between mind and symbol, reshaping both in the
process of transmission.

"To continue reading at today's speed I must have a machine," Bob Brown wrote in his famous
avant-garde manifesto *Readies* (1930), which some scholars take to presage the electronic
book. To these ends he imagined "a simple reading machine which I can carry or move around,
attach to any old electric light plug and read hundred thousand word novels in ten minutes if I
want to, and I want to."[^tn-brown] Print matter in Brown's vision would be distributed in
"dainty pillboxes" on mechanized rolls, wound automatically past a magnifying glass. "My
machine is equipped with controls so the reading record can be turned back or short ahead," he
wrote, "a chapter reread or the happy ending anticipated" [@brown_readies_1930, 29]. 

However, Brown's portentions did not rise out of a vacuum---they were accompanied by over a
century of technological developments in micrographic print, a history that itself was
concomitant with advances in photography. Where Nicéphore Niépce and Louis Jacques Mandé
Daguerre are conventionally considered to have invented photography in the 1830s, by 1857 the
*Encyclopaedia Britannica* included a discussion on "microscopic photography," by which tiny
"copies of dispatches and valuable paper and plans might be transmitted by post, and secrets
might be placed in spaces not larger than a full stop or a small blot of ink"
[@noauthor_microscope_1857, 802; @meckler_micropublishing_1982, 6]. It is reported that the
French photographer René Dagron sent more than 60,000 micrographic messages by pigeon carrier
during the Prussian siege of Paris in 1870 and in 1872 the Russian imperial military
experimented with micrographic maps for concealment and espionage [@luther_microfilm_1959,
143--62]. "It is natural that such results appear miraculous," wrote a pair of
librarian-engineers presenting their ideas "On a New Form of the Book: The Microphotographic
Book" (*Sur une forme novelle du livre: le livre microphotographique*) at the convention of
Institut International de Bibliographie held in Marseilles, France in 1906. Placed into a
"simple enlarger" and illuminated, text would be "projected on a ground glass that closes the
opposite side of the *camera obscura*," the authors explained. "It is there that the reading of
text will take place," they wrote:

> A slide positioned on the stage of a microscope of the carriage of a typewriter will
circulate the fiche from left to right and top to bottom. Then at the reader's will, the
microphotographic pages on each centimeter of the film will come successively in front of the
lens to be read.[@meckler_micropublishing_1982, 12].

In the United States, the long history of micrography included portable devices such as B.A.
Fiske's "Reading Machine," consisting of a hand-held magnifying glass wand (Figure 1) that was
to be passed over paper-tape medium (labeled 10 on the illustration). "I find it is entirely
feasible," Fiske wrote, "by suitable photographic or other process, to reduce a two and
one-half inch column of typewritten or printed matter to a column of one-quarter of an inch
wide, so that by arranging five such columns side by side of both sides of a paper tape [...]
it becomes possible to present one hundred thousand words, the length of an average book, on a
tape slightly longer than forty inches" [@fiske_reading_1922, 1]. By the 1920s micrographic
equipment was routinely manufactured by the Eastman Kodak company, Rectigraph (later Xerox),
and Remington Rand Corporation [@meckler_micropublishing_1982, 10--16].

In Brown's *Readies*, we glimpse the gradual reshaping of the book, made possible by the
storage capabilities of paper ribbons, glass plates, lenses, and rolls of celluloid.  Once
inseparable as a device and format, the book would gradually delaminate onto multiple surfaces:
some supporting its habituated semantic coherence---a progression of pages---others extending
it to include other modalities of reading, leafing, browsing, searching, and interpreting.

Electronic books came into being by multiple means, one of the earliest being a part of the
PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations), a computer controlled teaching
system, implemented at the University of Illinois, Urbana in the 1960s. PLATO's history as an
educational tool and a proto-internet information sharing network is well explored by
historians such as Joy Lisi Rankin, in her ground-breaking *People's History of Computing in
the United States* (Harvard University Press, 2018). Less known is PLATO's original coinage of
the term "electronic book," consisting of a "bank of slides," of the type usually "found in a
textbook or in class notes," but "prestored in an electronic slide selector" that could be
"shared by all the students," who were also able to "view same or different slides
simultaneously [...] by connecting electronically to the student's television display"
[@bitzer_uses_1966, 36; @rankin_peoples_2018, 171]. The system was capable of storing 122 such
slides, and to provide access to them in an arbitrary order in less than a microsecond
[@bitzer_uses_1966, 36]. In a parallel development circa 1962, the US National Science
Foundation announced "a new publishing program of electronic 'books' contained on magnetic
tape"---note the quotation marks that indicate a certain unease with the functional
transference between technological systems. Developed by Documentation, Inc., a Washington D.C.
firm, these so-called "computexts" were meant to facilitate "high-speed computer searches in
readable English." "An Electronic Index to Chemical Patents" was to be the first title released
to take advantage of that capability. "The electronic index will cover 150,000 patents issued
over the last 17-years," read the report, "the set of tapes covering this data can be contained
in only one cubic foot of storage space" [@national_science_foundation_electronic_1962, 4].

@pressman_machine_2011; @stephens_bob_2011.

Computexts and PLATO electronic books were enabled by the simultaneous maturing of three
technologies: magnetic tape storage, cathode ray tube (CRT) television, and the typewriter. As
a storage medium, tape offered a number of advantages over its predecessors. It was, as the
record has it, more portable than paper, punch cards, or celluloid. It lasted longer than other
mechanized forms of storage, because electro-magnetic reading and writing devices made light
contact with the tape---unlike, for example, punch-card systems, where the mechanism had to
physically protrude through the media in order to be read or written. Unlike hole-punches or
ink, magnetic polarities were easily reversible, making for a re-writable medium, in which
errors of transcription could be immediately reversed. Magnetic tape had one major weakness
however, in that it denied plain readability, electromagnetic inscription being invisible to
the human eye. The increasing commercialization of CRT television displays in the 1960s made
possible a restoration of human vision. Editing tapes directly with magnets or scissors was
also obviously impractical. An instrument equivalent to a pen was needed to facilitate
revision. Coupled with this system, a typewriter restored our tactile ability to edit stored
inscription. In concert, tube, tape, and typewriter could approximate the affordances of ink
and paper, creating a facsimile of page, and eventually a book.

By 1979, it was already possible to envisage a "portable, electronic viewing device" with
ambitions "to replace presently existing books, magazines, microfilm, computer printouts and
other printed media" [@rubincam_electronic_1979, 1]. In his US Patent 4,159,417 David Rubincam
proposed "an information storage and display apparatus [...] having a memory, a [laser] sensor
for sensing information from memory, logic circuitry operatively coupled with the sensor, and a
display in operative relationship with the logic circuitry for visually displaying the
information stored in memory" (Figure 2) [@rubincam_electronic_1979, 1]. The content of
Rubincam's electronic books was to be stored on holographic memory cards, one of which could
store up to 200 Mbits of data, or approximately ten average-sized volumes in plain text---text
without formatting or illustrations (Figure 3). The front of the device housed several
interfaces: a variable speed page turner switch (labeled 70), a page number display (72), ten
buttons by which a reader could enter specific pages (74), and several "fine tuning deflectors,
in the event that the laser beam is not centered properly on the hologram"
[@rubincam_electronic_1979, 5]. This last detail shows us that Rubincam still thought of his
holograms to stand in direct, one-to-one relationship to book pages. A physical movement over a
holographic medium would therefore entail the corresponding movement on a displayed page.  This
analogical correspondence would later be severed on media that contained nothing resembling
pages or paragraphs, but rather data structures, that could be reassembled into pages and
paragraphs in the process of rendering the image.

embodiment of the invention," and the bottom a memory card containing a "plurality of
holograms," along with its protective case.](images/rubincam-1.png)

In the historically contingent agglomeration of these three specific technologies---screen,
portable storage, and keyboard---we observe the development of a bridge-like structure,
expanding to span the gap between media and human sensory organs. Where minds and ideas inhabit
brains and bodies, inscriptions permeate a paper medium and increasingly occupy more remote
physicalites such as solid state drives (SSDs) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Such
disparate systems store information in radically divergent formats: the brain, as a lattice of
connected neurons; books, in chapters and paragraphs; and SSDs in polarized configurations of
floating gates. Despite these first-order material differences, we are able to recognize
similarities across media in content conceived in abstracted second-order structural terms.
Paragraphs in Virginia's Wolf's *To the Lighthouse* might be stored as a series of
non-sequential, fragmented patches of data, and that in contrast to the orderly procession of
paragraphs on a page. Second-order book sequences "take shape in the mind of the reader," where
"they are recreated and set up where the mind's eye can rest on them," the English critic Percy
Lubbock wrote in frustration about the novel. An interpretive gaze necessarily falls on
"certain fragments of the book which the author wrote," he continued, "the rest of it having
ceased to exist for us" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 3].  This "having ceased to exist" is literal,
for the eye continually leaves a pile of discarded pages in its wake.

Lubbock struggled conceptually, as did later Carline Levine in her *Forms: Whole, Rhythm,
Hierarchy, Network* (2015) because for them books indicated at once mental and physical
structures or, rather, perhaps because for most literary scholars the work usually takes
precedence over the object, making concerted materialism difficult if not impossible. Both
*Craft of Fiction* (1921) and *Forms* therefore stopped just short of media studies. "If only
there were one single tangible and measurable fact about the book," Lubbock wrote, "if it could
be weighed like a statute, say, or measured like a picture---it would support a world of
shadows" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 274]. But the book does exist tangibly on paper and in mind,
although in different formats. To traverse the two one need to disambiguate the meaning of the
book in the sense of "a mental form," from that in the sense of "a physical structure," and
further to attend to the dynamics of transposition between divergent media: hardware and
wetware, inscription, instrument, and biology.

The traversal between such first- and second plus-order structures follows strict and often
rigidly defined conventions, constituting the reification of thought into thing, or simply
format. Consider the popular EPUB format, which has its roots in the Open Book™ Publication
Structure (OEBPS). According to the Library of Congress records, the format was created in 1999
by the Open eBook Authoring Group, that consisted of "over 25 individuals from organizations
participating in the Open eBook initiative, launched in October 1998 [...] convened and
facilitated by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology.)" We learn also that
the Authoring Group "included participants representing all aspects of the electronic
publishing industry, and was open to any interested individual or organization." The document
begins with a statement of the group's purpose and scope: "to provide a specification for
representing the content of electronic books" and "to give content providers [...] minimal and
common guidelines which ensure fidelity, accuracy, accessibility, and presentation of
electronic content over various electronic book platforms" [@noauthor_oebps_2004, 1].

The concern with "various electronic book platforms," acknowledges the difficulty of describing
document structure under the conditions where the exact dimensions of the medium are not known
in advance. The Open Book could have been displayed on devices large and small, in full color
or monochrome, or on those devices providing "mainly audio or tactile interfaces"
[@noauthor_oebps_2004, 23].  The media agnostic nature of the format necessitated an abstracted
style layer, expressed in HTML/XML and CSS markup schemas, which would describe textual
elements such as footnotes and titles in relative terms such as left, right, top, bottom, or
center. In addition to these positional elements, the format specified social metadata, for
example "creator" and "contributor" types, including subtypes such as annotator, book producer,
collaborator, illustrator, printer, reviewer, sponsor, and translator among others
[@noauthor_oebps_2004 15-17].

The trademark symbol in the title of the standard, along with the copyright notice on its front
page, undermine its emphasis on the open, participatory nature of the endeavour. The admixture
of content, layout, and para-textual metadata further erodes the boundaries between strictly
formal, content-based abstractions (chapter, paragraph, page) and social roles encoded into,
although not apparent at the surface of the document. From the moment of its founding, the
"open" ebook format embeds and is embedded within the North American copyright regime, in a way
that would later allow "content creators," "persons or corporate bodies" to police access to
the "reading device," "the physical platform (hardware and software) on which publications are
rendered" [@noauthor_open_2010]. The reading platform emerges from this amalgam of text,
technology, body, and social structure. Platforms facilitate the transition from thought to
thing and therefore enters the realm of politics, being neither neutral nor a natural process.
Because formats ultimately determine channels of access and distribution, they are negotiated
and contested. Among the members of the EPUB working group we therefore find a preponderance of
corporate representatives from Adobe, Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, IBM, HarperCollins,
Pearson, Penguin, Random House, Sharp, and Sony.

What does a format format then? Following the EPUB example, we observe a series of envelopments
around the notion of content: the first semantic, by which ideational elements are ordered
symbolically (a progression of chapters, for example); second, spatial, by which semantic units
are laid out and oriented in space; third, technological, by which spatial units are rendered
on a device; next, corporeal, by which a reader's body can interface with the device; and
finally the social---political, legal, and economic---by which surface contact between bodies
and devices is negotiated. Formatting---mutual shaping---happens at each linkage in the long
chain of transmediation between symbol and society. Where books can represent any number of
such linked configurations, the book as a platform fixes a specific stack of symbolic,
technological, and social commitments into a rigid chain. For example, we understand that
Nintendo "the gaming platform" has something to do with Nintendo Co., Ltd., and that a
"Nintendo game", while under copyright, can only become a game on Nintendo-branded devices.
Amazon Kindle and Adobe Digital Edition platforms strive for the same sort of vertical
integration, even when the same work of art across platforms is still nominally called a book.
Specific textual witnesses always diverge materially from the archetype text in publication,
through printing error or editorial intervention.  But, when fixed into a platform, they begin
to diverge also in their "canned" interpretive capabilities: this book can be shared, and this
one cannot; this one is available in China and this one was redacted; I can take notes there
but not here.

Were telepathy real I would have liked to receive an author's thoughts directly, as a message
without mediation, but I cannot. I must reach through these mediating structures and not only
decode---understand and interpret---the message (all operations at the symbolic level), but
transform it materially back from paper shapes into brain shapes (operations at the level of
the material). Given the stability of a medium, such as the book after Gutenberg press and
before the internet, this process becomes naturalized and conventionally ignored.  Our
assumptions about hermeneutics---the art of interpretation---rest on habituated assumptions
about print, assumptions that cannot be sustained in other media. Problematically for the
reader of electronic books, the physics of computation rest in remote
materialities---electromagnetic polarities and floating gate transistors---not immediately
accessible to the human senses.  Software engineers and user interface designers have dealt
with this problem by simulating the affordances of a more familiar medium so as to rely on
already habituated intuitions. "Our familiarity with the metaphors binds us to their
nonrepresentational status," Johanna Drucker wrote on the importance of reading interfaces for
the PMLA [@drucker_reading_2013, 216]. A reader of an electronic text may "scroll" or "flip"
pages, in tacit understanding that such underlying motions involve neither scrolling nor
flipping, but bitwise operations, the movement of liquid crystals and polar field effects.

The tactile property of pages guides the eye and the hand to pace the cadence of reading in
real time. A reader's ability to read quickly or slowly is similarly limited by the affordances
of page turning. In reading for the plot, a reader can advance to its end in the manner that a
video game player cannot when playing a video game. Some digital readers can be configured to
page the book automatically, as Brown imagined it, and to measure the duration of the reading
engagement in time units (three hours left in this book) rather than in pages (200 pages left).
Obversely, a page format also affects the pacing of narrative, understood as a system of
symbolic orders. Elements of a plot must, for all their variability, fit within a book. Such
constraints are natural, arising from the material particularities of ink and paper---reading a
soggy book in torrential storm conditions, for example, is ill-advised---while others are
artificially and conventionally imposed, as is the case with page dimensions or the thickness
of paper used in print. A container "fits" its content just as it casts the hand and eye into
convenient grasping and gazing gestures. Further, at its outer edge, the imprint of a format
becomes the organizing principle governing the configuration of larger epistemic structures in
which it is embedded. In this way letters shape words, word shape paragraphs, paragraphs pages,
pages books, books shelves, shelves stacks, stacks libraries, libraries the episteme and the
world.

Interfaces determine the affordance of those actions that can be performed in concert between
heterotopic systems. Amidst the universes of hand and fork possibilities, there lies a subset
of actions available only to the combined set. It is not enough to say that a handle affords
grasping, rather, it suggests convenient grasping in a specific way, and conversely, prevents
other ways of grasping made inconvenient or impossible. An interface determines and governs
through its affordances, by spatial arrangement, conforming the hand to the handle and the
handle to the hand. In Drucker's sharp idiom, interfaces "interpolate a user through
disciplinary and scope regimes" and must be read as "spaces of individual and collective
subject formation." "Our notions of privacy, property, identity, and even individual voice and
self," she concludes, "are modified constantly in the exchange, bound to the cognitive modeling
of experience through experience" [@drucker_reading_2013, 217]. For media and otherwise
archaeologists, an interface bares the traces of its usage. Knowing nothing about human hands,
an alien visitor would reconstruct them by the shape of our household tools, input devices such
as mice and joysticks, and our eating and writing implements. Further, the affordances of such
artifacts would suggest their probable use: the difference between an axe and an adze, for
example, necessitates distinct swinging motions, optimizing each for differing purposes---one
for the cutting and the other for the carving of wood. But just as the difference in working
edges leaves distinct toolmarks in wood, their orientation also exhorts a specific body
posture. Formatting cuts both ways, in other words, constituting a mutual transposition of
shared possibilities between hand, tool, and material.

The shape of a printed book similarly places a number of constraints on the human body, which
include minimally sufficient visual acuity and manual dexterity. Other-abled bodies, those with
severe hyperopia for example, must resort to assistive devices such as reading glasses or
magnifying loupes. At the other side of the interface, the book also shapes content.  Literary
formats such as the novel or a short story define their measurements in relation to book
objects, manufactured to conventional specifications. A novel will always be longer than a few
pages and shorter than a million, and often at some average range between the possible
extremes. Micro- or macroscopic novels are possible, but impractical. Such objects would
violate the established techniques of access, storage, and distribution of books, optimized to
the equilibrium of convention.

In the late 1980s, a group of designers and engineers at Apple in collaboration with Grolier
Electronic Publishing were among those who turned to storytelling as formal means by which the
alien physicality's of a personal computer could be made more relatable for the general public.
The result of this multi-year project was *Guides*, an attempt to reimagine an encyclopedia of
North American history for young adults. Physically, its "delivery system" consisted of an
Apple Macintosh Plus (SE or II), with one megabyte of memory, "combined with a standard CD-ROM
drive and running Apple's HyperCard software" [@salomon_using_1989, 3]. HyperCards were Apple's
interface metaphor for a relational database, and an evocation of a new medium---billed as
hypermedia in corporate parlance and "programming for poets"---no longer constrained by its
analogy with print. A card could hold any type of information: text, sound, or video. Like an
index card, it could be stacked in any number of arbitrary configurations, shuffled, labeled,
or cross-referenced [@goodman_complete_1988, 1-15]. On a Macintosh Plus, a HyperCard occupied
the entirety of the screen, nine inches diagonally at 72 dots per inch resolution
[@salomon_using_1989, 3].

Apple, more so than other companies, understood that neither screens nor relational databases
were very approachable ideas for their target audience of home computer users. Programming
poets therefore turned to narrative theory to design interfaces that relied on familiar story
tropes. Brenda Laurel, who joined the Guides project shortly after completing her dissertation
on a "computer-based interactive fantasy system," wrote: "In the Guides project, the typical
spatial metaphor employed in most hypertext or hypermedia databases is replaced by the notion
of information, not as a space, but as *a series of events unfolding over time*," or, in other
words, a narrative [@laurel_computers_1991, 182].  "Narrative includes both the story being
told (content) and the conditions of its telling (structure and context," another member of
team explained: "Interface designers can adopt strategies from narrative theory, such as
including multiple representations of events and information, or using characters as a means of
representing material with an explicitly acknowledged points of view" [@laurel_computers_1991,
182; @abbe_narrative_1990, 383]. The guide personalities for the encyclopedia were in reality
several faceted "topical keys," or labels, "created by the editors for classifying the articles
within the database [@salomon_using_1989, 7]. A taxonomic, epistemological formation in a
catalog of articles was therefore grouped under several available personalities, such as
settler, sea captain, scout, inventor, slave, and Indian. "Information always reflects
something about its source and its purpose," Laurel wrote. It is a "made thing, influenced by
its efficient, formal, material, and end causes" [@laurel_computers_1991, 179]. A point of
view, however archetypical, could thus de-center the seemingly universal epistemological claims
to objectivity implicit in the notion of a technical database.

the editors for classifying the articles within the database" (7). Salomon, Gitta, Tim Oren,
and Kristee Kreitman. “Using Guides to Explore Multimedia Databases.” In Proceedings of the

Laudable as these design goals were for undermining a singular, heroic narrative of American
settler colonialism, they came at the cost of another deterritorialization. Material contexts
of electromagnetic storage, difficult to traverse even for experienced software engineers, were
elided in favor of successively nested metaphors. First, a database, in itself a logical
structure meant to simplify tedious data manipulations in computer memory. Second, the
HyperCard, which encased database abstractions within the more familiar language of office
supplies, cards, decks, and stacks. And finally, in a yet another metaphorical envelopment,
HyperCards were represented in terms of anthropomorphic system agents that appeared in the
guise of historical actors. The chain of mediation between reader and inscription was
lengthened throughout, substituting material contexts for the metaphorical. Such nested
metaphors underpinning the new encyclopedia of American history created a hierarchy of readers,
whose most numerous members were also the least trusted to affect the material conditions of
their interpretive activity.

My reading of Woolf's *To the Lighthouse* on Amazon Kindle today is similarly circumscribed.
The Kindle platform encompasses a number of similar devices, a piece of software on my mobile
phone, an online application, and a file format, extending the EPUB standard to include
stronger, cryptographic assurances against unauthorized use. It is ultimately a marketplace
that extracts value from the distribution of goods, including those such as *To the Lighthouse*
already in the public domain. A screen overlay called "About This Book" greets the reader on
opening the volume. Here, I learn the novel received four stars on average by 470 readers.  and
that most readers finish the novel in 3 hours and 17 minutes. I am given the option to "follow"
Virginia Woolf in order to receive new release alerts along with "occasional announcements"
[@noauthor_amazon.com_nodate]. I learn also that 583 passages in the novel were highlighted
5,848 times by other fans of the author. Among the most popular, is one at location 114 of 2762
on my device (there are no page numbers on this version of the book): "It seemed to her such
nonsense---inventing differences, when people, heaven knows, where different enough without
that." My edition is published by Feedbooks, a "cloud" publisher specializing in re-printing
digital works in the public domain [@noauthor_about_nodate]. The Amazon Kindle application
keeps track of and synchronizes my reading activity across multiple devices. I am reminded that
*To the Lighthouse* is also available as an audiobook narrated by Juliet Stevenson. Sponsored

Like Lubbock and Levine, I struggle to find my own critical bearings in relation to such
densely winding and wound structure of inscription so circumscribed. To get to the novel, I
followed a long chain of material transpositions---transcoding and transmediation---so remote
and alien in fact, at the scale of electromagnetic and quantum phenomena, that such physical
manipulations themselves were now presented to me in second, third, and n-plus order notational
terms. What I observe on the screen of a contemporary electronic book is a facet of a complex
and phantasmal shape, fractured across multiple surfaces, stored in varying formats, each
affording divergent possibilities for interpretation depending on a reader's placement and
literal privileges of access to aspects of the structure. The electronic book before me is a
novel, a device, a file format, a piece of software, a marketplace, a piece of glass, a
tracking device, and a space for annotation.

This agglomeration of disparate components is unlikely to last in its present form. Because
many parts of the book platform are proprietary, our libraries are not equipped to archive book
platforms. Books written or purchased under the auspices of closed systems, may soon go the way
of Atari Jaguar or Saga Dreamcast. Under the terms of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, US
Code Title 17, Chapter 12, Section 1201 scholars may be prohibited from "circumventing a
technological measures that effectively control access to a work protected under this title."
Platform makers may by such legal means embed instruments of censorship or surveillance into
cultural works, in a way that makes them physically resistant to interpretation or critique.
Remarkably, we know less about the history of electronic publishing than we do about the
medieval book. The era of desktop publishing for example, spurred on by advances in personal
printing and page layout software, is almost entirely missing from the record.

The gaps in the schematic history of the electronic book I have outlined above may come into a
greater focus by a more closer integration of vocabularies between the related fields of book
history, textual criticism, philology, and media studies. A platform- and
infrastructure-studies approach to book history would thicken the description of text as
inscription suspended not only in its immediate substratum, paper or screen, but also within
the broader scaffolding, spanning symbolic, technological, and social topographies. "Our field
of play is the entire field of communication," the editors of *Book History* wrote in their
inaugural issue [@noauthor_introduction_1998, ix]. This scholarly project remains essential in
a democratic society, in which communication is increasingly facilitated by online platforms.
Where Brown imagined books that circulate in "dainty little pillboxes," books of the future may
take other fantastical forms, including actual pills and other technologies of memory
imprinting.[^ln-memory] Yet neither speed, nor efficacy, nor optogenetics, should obscure the
mechanisms of mediation.

Despite what the popular highlights suggest, I would like to dwell rather on the sonic cadence
of the waves in *To the Lighthouse*, which for Mrs. Ramsay usually provided "measured and
soothing" affirmation, "a tattoo [!] to her thoughts," in the background of daily experience.
"But at other times," Woolf writes, "this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the
other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears," and "like a ghostly roll of drums,
remorselessly beat the measure of life, made one think of the destruction of the island and its
engulfment in the sea" [@woolf_lighthouse_1927]. In moments such as these, I think of Woolf as
a great theorist of elemental media, who points the way toward the study of technological
engulfment.

"optogenetically manipulating memory engram-bearing cells in the hippocampus." See
