To imagine a possible future of the book, in light of its pasts, I would like to present not so
much a final shape or an object, but rather a sketch---a roadmap---for the study of objects
that very much resemble books, yet require a theoretical reconfiguration so as to appear to the
critical gaze in their full complexity and sheer alien difference to the familiar---still not
without their mystery---constellations made of paper and ink. This sketch will be an
opportunity to introduce several terms borrowed from the fields of media studies and computer
science, terms that should equip us to better understand those areas of the map already
explored and those still in need of description, pathfinding, and analysis. The interleaved
media archaeology of several electronic books will serve to ground theoretical principles in
observed practice.

Key to this understanding is a presupposition shared by most book historians, textual critics,
and media scholars, which manifests in the attention to the social and material contexts of
ideational content, in light of which a book represents, at once, a metaphysical construct of
the mind, a physical object, and a practice of reading. Matter envelops symbol to produce a
specifically instantiated thing. Therefore, a reader's ability to reach anything like content
---a work of art---is circumscribed by the medium within which such content is embedded---an
object of art---further contained by the social structures that once again mediate and are
mediated by their symbolic and technological containments.

A reader's inability to "grasp the shadowy and fantasmal form of the book" in its entirety, "to
hold it fast, to turn it over and survey it at leisure" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 1] stems from the
fundamental incompatibilities between the innermost symbolic, purely discursive, realms and the
outermost, corporeal, and purely embodied techniques of comprehension: the first, limited by
the expressive possibilities of language and the second by the cognitive and perceptual
mechanics of the human body. Techniques of mediation between the two are therefore neither
wholly determinate nor wholly socially constructed. Rather, they develop through a series of
negotiated protocols, by which specific interfaces or channels of transmission develop between
disparate symbolisms and physicalities. The trans-mediation of mind-things into paper and ink
things entails the corresponding trans-figuration of content, the latter in the simple sense of
that which is being contained. A line of reasoning inhabits a paragraph on a page, although the
two structures do not transpose perfectly. The structure of thoughts in the mind---their
transcendent form---and the structure of lines on a page---their immanent format---meet at the
interface of two incompatible systems, the symbolic and biological. An interface enables the
compatibility between physically heterotopic systems at the point of contact. In this way, the
tail end of a fork is molded to conform to the hand, where it begins to resemble a hand,
bearing the imprint of a palm and its digits. A hand for its part becomes more fork-like in the
grasping of the tool. Similarly, the interface of a digital book is that physical adaptation
that allows for the physical exchange between between mind and symbol, reshaping both in the
process of transmission.

"To continue reading at today's speed I must have a machine," Bob Brown wrote in his famous
avant-garde manifesto *Readies* (1930), which some scholars take to presage the electronic
book. To these ends he imagined "a simple reading machine which I can carry or move around,
attach to any old electric light plug and read hundred thousand word novels in ten minutes if I
want to, and I want to."[^tn-brown] Print matter in Brown's vision would be distributed in
"dainty pillboxes" on mechanized rolls, wound automatically under a magnifying glass. "My
machine is equipped with controls so the reading record can be turned back or short ahead," he
wrote, "a chapter reread or the happy ending anticipated" [@brown_readies_1930, 29]. 

However, Brown's portentions did not rise out of a vacuum---they were accompanied by over a
century of technological developments in micrographic print, a history that itself was
concomitant with advances in photography.[^ln-micrography] Where Nicéphore Niépce and Louis
Jacques Mandé Daguerre are conventionally considered to have invented photography in the 1830s,
by 1857 the *Encyclopaedia Britannica* included a discussion on "microscopic photography," by
which tiny "copies of dispatches and valuable paper and plans might be transmitted by post, and
secrets might be placed in spaces not larger than a full stop or a small blot of ink"
[@noauthor_microscope_1857, 802; @meckler_micropublishing_1982, 6]. It is reported that the
French photographer René Dagron sent more than 60,000 micrographic messages by pigeon carrier
during the Prussian siege of Paris in 1870 and in 1872 the Russian imperial military
experimented with micrographic maps for concealment and espionage [@luther_microfilm_1959,
143--62]. "It is natural that such results appear miraculous," wrote a pair of
librarian-engineers presenting their ideas "On a New Form of the Book: The Microphotographic
Book" (Sur une forme novelle du livre: le livre microphotographique) at the convention of
Institut International de Bibliographie held in Marseilles, France in 1906. Placed into a
"simple enlarger" and illuminated, text would be "projected on a ground glass that closes the
opposite side of the *camera obscura*," the authors explained. "It is there that the reading of
text will take place," they wrote:

> A slide positioned on the stage of a microscope of the carriage of a typewriter will
circulate the fiche from left to right and top to bottom. Then at the reader's will, the
microphotographic pages on each centimeter of the film will come successively in front of the
lens to be read.[@meckler_micropublishing_1982, 12].

In the United States, the long history of micrography included portable devices such as B.A.
Fiske's "Reading Machine," consisting of a hand-held magnifying glass wand (Figure 1) that was
to be passed over paper-tape medium (labeled 10 on the illustration). "I find it is entirely
feasible," Fiske wrote, "by suitable photographic or other process, to reduce a two and
one-half inch column of typewritten or printed matter to a column of one-quarter of an inch
wide, so that by arranging five such columns side by side of both sides of a paper tape [...]
it becomes possible to present one hundred thousand words, the length of an average book, on a
tape slightly longer than forty inches" [@fiske_reading_1922, 1]. By the 1920s micrographic
equipment was routinely manufactured by the Eastman Kodak company, Rectigraph (later Xerox),
and Remington Rand Corporation [@meckler_micropublishing_1982, 10--16].

In Brown's *Readies*, we glimpse the gradual reshaping of the book, made possible by the
storage capabilities of paper ribbons, glass plates, lenses, and rolls of celluloid.  Once
inseparable as a device and format, the book would gradually delaminate onto multiple surfaces:
some supporting its habituated semantic coherence---a progression of pages---others extending
it to include other modalities of reading, leafing, browsing, searching, and interpreting.

Electronic books came into being in multiple guises, one of the earliest being a part of the
PLATO (Programmed Logic for Automatic Teaching Operations), a computer controlled teaching
system, implemented at the University of Illinois, Urbana in the 1960s. PLATO's history as an
educational tool and a proto-internet information sharing network is well explored by
historians such as Joy Lisi Rankin, in her ground-breaking *People's History of Computing in
the United States* (Harvard University Press, 2018). Less known is PLATO's original coinage of
the term "electronic book," consisting of a "bank of slides," of the type usually "found in a
textbook or in class notes," but "prestored in an electronic slide selector" that could be
"shared by all the students," who were also able to "view same or different slides
simultaneously [...] by connecting electronically to the student's television display"
[@bitzer_uses_1966, 36; @rankin_peoples_2018, 171]. The system was capable of storing 122 such
slides, and to provide access to them in an arbitrary order in less than a microsecond
[@bitzer_uses_1966, 36]. In a parallel development circa 1962, the US National Science
Foundation announced "a new publishing program of electronic 'books' contained on magnetic
tape"---note the quotation marks that indicate a certain unease with the functional
transference between technological systems. Developed by Documentation, Inc., a Washington D.C.
firm, these so-called "computexts" were meant to facilitate "high-speed computer searches in
readable English." "An Electronic Index to Chemical Patents" was to be the first title released
to take advantage of that capability. "The electronic index will cover 150,000 patents issued
over the last 17-years," read the report, "the set of tapes covering this data can be contained
in only one cubic foot of storage space" [@national_science_foundation_electronic_1962, 4].

@pressman_machine_2011; @stephens_bob_2011.

Computexts and PLATO electronic books were enabled by the simultaneous maturing of three
technologies: magnetic tape storage, cathode ray tube (CRT) television, and the typewriter. As
a storage medium, tape offered a number of advantages over its predecessors. It was, as the
documents note, more portable than paper, punch cards, or celluloid. It lasted longer than
other mechanized forms of storage, because electro-magnetic reading and writing devices made
light contact with the tape---unlike, for example, punch-card systems, where the mechanism had
to physically protrude through the media in order to be read or written. Unlike hole-punches or
ink, magnetic polarities were easily reversible, making for a re-writable medium, in which
errors of transcription could be immediately reversed. Magnetic tape had one major weakness
however, in that it denied plain readability, electromagnetic inscription being invisible to
the human eye. The increasing commercialization of CRT television displays in the 1960s made
possible a restoration of human vision. Editing tapes directly with magnets or scissors was
also obviously impractical. An instrument equivalent to a pen was needed to facilitate
revision. Coupled with this system, a typewriter restored our tactile ability to edit stored
inscription. In concert, tube, tape, and typewriter could approximate the affordances of ink
and paper, creating a facsimile of page, and eventually a book.

By 1979, it was already possible to imagine to imagine a "portable, electronic viewing device
to replace presently existing books, magazines, microfilm, computer printouts and other printed
media" [@rubincam_electronic_1979, 1]. In his US Patent 4,159,417 David Rubincam proposed "an
information storage and display apparatus [...] having a memory, a [laser] sensor for sensing
information from memory, logic circuitry operatively coupled with the sensor, and a display in
operative relationship with the logic circuitry for visually displaying the information stored
in memory" (Figure 2) [@rubincam_electronic_1979, 1]. The content of Rubincam's electronic
books was to be stored on holographic memory cards, one of which could store up to 200 Mbits of
data, or approximately ten average-sized volumes in plain text---text without formatting or
illustrations (Figure 3). The front of the device housed several interfaces: a variable speed
page turner switch (labeled 70), a page number display (72), ten buttons by which a reader
could enter specific pages (74), and several "fine tuning deflectors, in the event that the
laser beam is not centered properly on the hologram" [@rubincam_electronic_1979, 5]. It wold

embodiment of the invention," and the bottom a memory card containing a "plurality of
holograms," along with its protective case.](images/rubincam-1.png)

In the historically contingent agglomeration of these three specific technologies---screen,
portable storage, and keyboard---we observe the development of a bridge-like structure,
expanding to span the gap between media and human sensory organs. Where minds and ideas inhabit
brains and bodies, inscriptions permeate a paper medium and increasingly occupy more remote
physicalites such as solid state drives (SSDs) and liquid crystal displays (LCDs). Such
disparate systems store information in radically divergent formats: the brain, as a lattice of
connected neurons; books, in chapters and paragraphs; and SSDs in polarized configurations of
floating gates. Despite these first-order material differences, we are able to recognize
similarities across media in content conceived in purely symbolic, second-order structural
terms. The paragraphs of Virginia's Wolf's *To the Lighthouse* might be stored in a completely
non-sequential, fragmented patches of data, and that in contrast to the orderly procession of
paragraphs on a page. Second-order book sequences "take shape in the mind of the reader," where
"they are recreated and set up where the mind's eye can rest on them," the English critic Percy
Lubbock wrote in frustration about the novel. An interpretive gaze necessarily falls on
"certain fragments of the book which the author wrote," he continued, "the rest of it having
ceased to exist for us" [@lubbock_craft_1921, 3].  This "having ceased to exist" is literal,
for the eye continually leaves a pile of discarded pages in its wake.

Lubbock struggles conceptually, as does later Carline Levine in her *Forms: Whole, Rhythm,
Hierarchy, Network* (2015) because for them books indicate at once mental and physical
structures or, rather, perhaps because for most literary scholar the work usually takes
precedence over the object, making concerted materialism difficult if not impossible. Both
*Craft of Fiction* (1921) and *Forms* therefore stop just short of media studies. "If only
there were one single tangible and measurable fact about the book," Lubbock wrote, "if it could
be weighed like a statute, say, or measured like a picture---it would support a world of
shadows" [@lubbock, 274]. But the book does exist tangibly on paper and in mind, although in
different formats. To traverse the two one need to disambiguate the meaning of the book in the
sense of "a mental form," from that in the sense of "a physical structure," and further to
attend to the mechanisms of transposition between divergent media: hardware and wetware,
inscription, instrument, and biology.

In the late 1980s, a group of designers and engineers at Apple were among those rethinking the
role of mediation in contemporary storytelling, in collaboration with Grolier Electronic
Publishing. The result of this multi-year project was *Guides*, an attempt to reimagine the an
encyclopedia of American history for young adults. Physically, its "delivery system" consisted
of an Apple Macintosh Plus (SE or II), with one megabyte of memory, "combined with a standard
CD-ROM drive and running Apple's HyperCard software" [@salomon_using_1989, 3]. HyperCards were
Apple's interface metaphor for a relational database, and an attempt to evoke a
medium---hypermedia in their corporate parlance and "programming for poets!"---no longer
constrained by its analogy with print. A card could hold any type of information: text, sound,
or video. Like an index card, it could be stacked in any number of arbitrary configurations,
shuffled, labeled, and cross-referenced [@goodman_complete_1988, 1-15]. On a small screen of
the period---nine inches diagonally at 72 dots per inch resolution---a HyperCard occupied the
entirety of the screen [@salomon_using_1989, 3].

The traversal between such first- and second plus-order structures follows strict and often
rigidly defined conventions, constituting the reification of thought into thing, or simply
format. Consider the popular EPUB format, which has its roots in the Open Book™ Publication
Structure (OEBPS). According to the Library of Congress records, the format was created in 1999
by the Open eBook Authoring Group, that consisted of "over 25 individuals from organizations
participating in the Open eBook initiative, launched in October 1998 [...] convened and
facilitated by NIST (the National Institute of Standards and Technology.)" We learn also that
the Authoring Group "included participants representing all aspects of the electronic
publishing industry, and was open to any interested individual or organization." The document
begins with a statement of the group's purpose and scope: "to provide a specification for
representing the content of electronic books" and "to give content providers [...] minimal and
common guidelines which ensure fidelity, accuracy, accessibility, and presentation of
electronic content over various electronic book platforms" [@oebps, 1].

The concern with "various electronic book platforms," acknowledges the difficulty of describing
document structure under the conditions where the exact dimensions of the medium are not known
in advance. The Open Book could have been displayed on devices large and small, in full color
or monochrome, or on those devices providing "mainly audio or tactile interfaces" [@oebps, 23].
The media agnostic nature of the format necessitated an abstracted style layer, expressed in
HTML/XML and CSS markup schemas, which would describe textual elements such as footnotes and
titles in relative terms such as left, right, top, bottom, or center. In addition to these
positional elements, the format specified social metadata, for example "creator" and
"contributor" types, including subtypes such as annotator, book producer, collaborator,
illustrator, printer, reviewer, sponsor, and translator among others [@oebps, 15-17].

The trademark symbol in the title of the standard, along with the copyright notice on its front
page, work against the grain of its social claims that emphasize the open, participatory nature
of the endeavour. The admixture of content, layout, and para-textual metadata further erodes
the boundaries between strictly formal, content-based abstractions (chapter, paragraph, page)
and social roles encoded into, if not always apparent at the surface of the document. From the
moment of its founding, the "open" ebook format embeds and is embedded within the North
American copyright regime, in a way that would later allow "content creators," "persons or
corporate bodies" to police access to the "reading device," "the physical platform (hardware
and software) on which publications are rendered" [@ops 2.0.1]. The reading platform emerges
from this amalgam of text, technology, body, and social structure. The platform facilitates the
transition from thought to thing and therefore enters the realm of politics, being neither
neutral nor a natural process. Because formats ultimately determine channels of access and
distribution, they are negotiated and contested. The EPUB working group was historically
dominated by corporate representatives from Adobe, Apple, Barnes & Noble, Google, IBM,
HarperCollins, Pearson, Penguin, Random House, Sharp, and Sony.

What does a format format then? Following the EPUB example, we observe a series of envelopments
around the notion of content: the first semantic, by which ideational elements are ordered
symbolically (a progression of chapters, for example); second, spatial, by which semantic units
are laid out and oriented in space; third, technological, by which spatial units are rendered
on a device; next, corporeal, by which a reader's body can interface with the device; and
finally the social---political, legal, and economic---by which surface contact between bodies
and devices is negotiated. Formatting---mutual shaping---happens at each linkage in the long
chain of transmediation between symbol and society. And where a book can identify any number of
such linked configurations, the book as a platform fixes all into a rigid chain. Colloquially,
we therefore understand that Nintendo "the gaming platform" has something to do with Nintendo
Nintendo Co., Ltd., and that a "Nintendo game", while under copyright, can only become a game
on Nintendo-branded devices. Amazon Kindle and Adobe Digital Edition platforms strive for the
same vertical integration, even when their products are still nominally called books.

If telepathy were real I would have liked to receive an author's thoughts directly, as a
message without mediation, but I cannot. I must reach through these mediating structures and
not only decode---understand and interpret---the message (all operations at the level of
symbol), but transform it materially back from paper shapes into brain shapes. Given the
stability of a medium, such as the book after Gutenberg press and before the internet, this
process becomes naturalized and conventionally ignored.  Our assumptions about
hermeneutics---the art of interpretation---rest on habituated assumptions about print,
assumptions that cannot be sustained in other media. Problematically for the reader of
electronic books, the physics of computation rest in remote materialities---electromagnetic
polarities and floating gate transistors---not immediately accessible to the human senses.
Software engineers and user interface designers have dealt with this problem by simulating the
affordances of a more familiar medium so as to rely on already habituated intuitions. A reader
of an electronic text may "scroll" or "flip" pages, in tacit understanding that the underlying
motions involve neither scrolling nor flipping, but bitwise operations, the movement of liquid
crystals and polar field effects.

The tactile property of pages guides the eye and the hand in a way to create a cadence of
reading in real time. A reader's ability to read quickly or slowly is similarly limited by the
affordances of page turning. In reading for the plot, a reader can advance to its end in the
manner that a video game player cannot when playing a video game.  Some digital readers can
even be configured to page the book automatically, as Brown imagined it, and to measure the
duration of the reading engagement in time units (three hours left in this book) rather than in
pages (200 pages left).  Obversely, a page format affects the pacing of narrative, as a system
of symbolic order.  Elements of a plot must, for all their variability, fit within the book.
Such constraints are natural, arising from the material particularities of ink and paper---for
example, reading a soggy book in torrential storm conditions cannot be advised---while others
are artificially and conventionally imposed, as is the case with page dimensions or the
thickness of paper used in the production of a book. A container "fits" its content just as it
casts the hand and eye into convenient grasping and gazing gestures. Further, at its outer
edge, the imprint of a container becomes the organizing principle governing the configuration
of larger epistemic structures in which it is embedded. In this way letters shape words, word
shape paragraphs, paragraphs pages, pages books, books shelves, shelves stacks, stacks
libraries, libraries the episteme and the world.

Interfaces determine the affordance of those actions that can be performed in concert between
heterotopic systems. Amidst the universes of hand and fork possibilities, there lies a subset
of actions available only to the combined set. It is not enough to say that a handle affords
grasping, rather, it suggests convenient grasping in a specific way, and conversely, prevents
other ways of grasping made inconvenient and impossible. An interface determines or governs
through its affordances, by spatial arrangement, conforming the hand to the handle and the
handle to the hand. For an archaeologist or a media archaeologist, interfaces bare the traces
of its usage. Knowing nothing about human hands, an alien visitor would reconstruct them by the
shape of our household tools, input devices such as mice and joysticks, and our eating and
writing implements. Further, the affordance of such artifacts would suggest their probable use:
the difference between an axe and an adze, for example, necessitates distinct swinging motions,
optimizing each for differing purposes---one for the cutting and the other for the carving of
wood. But just as it leaves distinct toolmarks in wood, the orientation of the working edge
also exhorts a specific body posture.

By the logic of interfaces and affordances, the shape of a printed book contains a number of
assumptions about the human body, which include minimally sufficient visual acuity and manual
dexterity. Other-abled bodies, those with severe hyperopia for example, must resort to
assistive devices such as reading glasses or magnifying loupes. At the other side of the
interface, the book also shapes content. Literary formats such as the novel or a short story
define their measurements in relation to book objects, manufactured to conventional
specifications. A novel will always be longer than a few pages and shorter than a million, and
often at the some average range between the possible extremes. Micro- or macroscopic novels are
possible, but impractical. Such objects would violate the established mechanisms of access,
storage, and distribution of books, optimized to the equilibrium of convention.

The schematic representation of the book which I am attempting to sketch out here emerges in
the technological envelopment of symbolic material, to fuse into a structure that is further
encapsulated with its social context. At the outer limits of the textual universe, book as a
*platform* exists with the complexity of authors, readers, publishers, censors, librarians,
rook sellers, collectors, and book pirates, for whom books serve as tokens of cultural and
financial capital. These platforms usually exist as organic outgrowths of localized ad-hoc
development. A book market in Lahore, Pakistan looks different from that of Chisinau, Moldova
and yet more different from that found in New York, USA.

"About This Book shows you additional information about your book the first time you open it."
Four starts at average by 469 readers. A typical time to read 3 hours and 23 pages. I can
"follow" Virginia Woolf's author pages, I am recommended other works by the author and informed
of 583 passages highlight 5,848 times. "And, what was even more exciting, she felt, too, as she
saw Mr Ramsay bearding down and retreating, and Mrs ramsay sitting with James in the windo and
the cloud moving and the tree bending, how life, from bein made up of little separate incidents
which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one
down with it, there, with a dash on the beach" [@woolf, location 626].

Because the book is a platform and not merely an For reason, a universal theory of the book,
and consequently a universal theory of literature is impossible. The act of interpretation
holds true for locally contingent agglomerations of signs, media, and bodies, stable only in
specific and limited historical, cultural, and economic contexts.
