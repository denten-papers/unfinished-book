Reading Platforms

To imagine a possible future of the book, in light of its pasts, I would like to present not so
much a final shape or an object, but rather a sketch---a roadmap---for the study of objects
that very much resemble books, yet require a theoretical reconfiguration so as to appear to the
critical gaze in their full complexity and sheer alien difference to the familiar---still not
without their mystery---constellations made of paper and ink. This sketch will be an
opportunity to introduce several terms borrowed from the fields of media studies and computer
science, terms that should equip us to better understand those explored areas of the map and
those still in need of description, pathfinding, history, and analysis.

Key to this understanding is a presupposition shared by most book historians, textual critics,
and media scholars, which manifests in the attention to the material contexts of ideational
content, for the book represents, at once, a metaphysical construct of the mind and a physical
object. Matter envelops symbol to produce a specifically instantiated thing. Therefore, a
reader's ability to reach anything like content or a work of art, is limited by or facilitated
by the medium. By that logic, the book is a container for the storage of ideas.

Before us is a

The trans-mediation of mind-things into paper and ink things entails the corresponding
trans-figuration of "content." A line of reasoning resembles a line on a page or a paragraph,
although the two do not transpose perfectly. The structure of thoughts in the abstract---their
transcendent form---and the structure of words on a page---their immanent *format*---meet at
the *interface* of two incompatible systems, the symbolic and biological. An interface is a
point of contact that allows compatibility between physically heterotopic systems. In this way,
the tail end of a fork is shaped to conform to the hand and in that sense begins to resemble a
hand, bearing the imprint of its palm and digits. The hand for its part becomes more fork-like
in grasping the tool.

An interface determines the *affordance* of those actions that can be performed in concert
between heterotopic systems. Amidst the universes of hand and fork possibilities, there lies a
subset of actions available only to the combined set. It is not enough to say that a handle
affords grasping, rather, it suggests convenient grasping in a specific way, and conversely,
prevents other ways of grasping made inconvenient and impossible. An interface determines or
governs through its affordances, by spatial arrangement, conforming the hand to the handle and
the handle to the hand. For an archaeologist or a media archaeologist, interfaces bare the
traces of its usage. Knowing nothing about human hands, an alien visitor would reconstruct them
by the shape of our household tools, input devices such as mice and joysticks, and our eating
and writing implements. Further, the affordance of such artifacts would suggest their probable
use: the difference between an axe and an adze, for example, necessitates distinct swinging
motions, optimizing each for differing purposes---one for the cutting and the other for the
carving of wood. But just as it leaves distinct toolmarks in wood, the orientation of the
working edge also exhorts a specific body posture.

By the logic of interfaces and affordances, the shape of a printed book contains a number of
assumptions about the human body, which include minimally sufficient visual acuity and manual
dexterity. Other-abled bodies, those with severe hyperopia for example, must resort to
assistive devices such as reading glasses or magnifying loupes. At the other side of the
interface, the book also shapes content. Literary formats such as the novel or a short story
define their measurements in relation to book objects, manufactured to conventional
specifications. A novel will always be longer than a few pages and shorter than a million, and
often at the some average range between the possible extremes. Micro- or macroscopic novels are
possible, but impractical. Such objects would violate the established mechanisms of access,
storage, and distribution of books, optimized to the equilibrium of convention.

These limitations show how the discrete nature of pages structures the pacing of reading on the
one hand, and the pacing of narrative on the other. Elements of a plot must, for all their
variability, fit within the book. A reader's ability to read quickly or slowly is similarly
limited by the affordances of page turning. In reading for the plot, a reader can advance to
its end in the manner that a video game player cannot when playing a video game.  Some such
constraints are natural, arising from the material particularities of ink and paper---for
example, reading a soggy book in torrential storm conditions cannot be advised---while others
are artificially and conventionally imposed, as is the case with page dimensions or the
thickness of paper used in the production of a book. A container "fits" its content just as it
casts the hand and eye into convenient grasping and gazing gestures. Further, at its outer
edge, the imprint of a container becomes the organizing principle governing the configuration
of larger epistemic structures in which it is embedded. In this way letters shape words, word
shape paragraphs, paragraphs pages, pages books, books shelves, shelves stacks, stacks
libraries, libraries the episteme and the world.

If telepathy were real I would have liked to receive an author's thoughts directly, as a
message without mediation, but I cannot. I must reach through these mediating structures and
not only decode---understand and interpret---the message (all operations at the level of
symbol), but trans-mediate it materially back from paper shapes into brain shapes. Given the
stability of a medium, such as the book after Gutenberg press and before the internet, this
process becomes naturalized and conventionally ignored.  Our assumptions about
hermeneutics---the art of interpretation---rest on habituated assumptions about print,
assumptions that cannot be sustained in other media.  Problematically for the reader of
electronic books, the physics of computation rest in remote materialities---electromagnetic
polarities and floating gate transistors---not immediately accessible to the human senses.
Software engineers and user interface designers have dealt with this problem by simulating the
affordances of a more familiar medium so as to rely on already habituated intuitions. A reader
of an electronic text may "scroll" or "flip" pages, in tacit understanding that the underlying
motions involve neither scrolling nor flipping, but bitwise operations, the movement of liquid
crystals and polar field effects.

The schematic representation of the book which I am attempting to sketch out here emerges in
the technological envelopment of symbolic material, to fuse into a structure that is further
encapsulated with its social context. At the outer limits of the textual universe, book as a
*platform* exists with the complexity of authors, readers, publishers, censors, librarians,
rook sellers, collectors, and book pirates, for whom books serve as tokens of cultural and
financial capital. These platforms usually exist as organic outgrowths of localized ad-hoc
development. A book market in Lahore, Pakistan looks different from that of Chisinau, Moldova
and yet more different from that found in New York, USA.
