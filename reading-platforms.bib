	abstract = {Bob Brown's 1930––1931 reading machine hyperbolically attempts to eradicate the difference between human and book, as well as between local reading and global reading. Brown could thus be described somewhat anachronistically as an example of what Luciano Floridi refers to as an ““inforg,”” an ““interconnected organism . . . sharing with biological agents and engineered artifacts a global environment ultimately made of information, the infosphere.”” Brown's reading machine, I suggest most provocatively, fashions readers and writers as global word processors avant le lettre, or rather post le lettre. The reading machine implies that electronically transmitted language will alter the nature of literary form; at the same time, it parodies the Americanization of the wor(l)d brought about by new technologies of communication.},

The user is given a selection of images of people who embody easily understood points of view. A user can choose a guide as a companion while browsing the database. At each database node the user is provided with the guides next choice and thus can follow the interest path of a certain type of individual. The graphical tools and interface provided to the text, graphics and sound database are presented. The design and functionality of alphabetical and topical indexes, multimedia tours, timelines and animated maps are detailed. Future directions for development are indicated. The concept of guides can be easily generalized and applied to other databases.{\textless}{\textgreater}},
