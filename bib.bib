Brown could thus be described somewhat anachronistically as an example of what Luciano Floridi refers to as an ““inforg,”” an ““interconnected organism . . . sharing with biological agents and engineered artifacts a global environment ultimately made of information, the infosphere.”” Brown's reading machine, I suggest most provocatively, fashions readers and writers as global word processors avant le lettre, or rather post le lettre. The reading machine implies that electronically transmitted language will alter the nature of literary form; at the same time, it parodies the Americanization of the wor(l)d brought about by new technologies of communication.},

At each database node the user is provided with the guides next choice and thus can follow the interest path of a certain type of individual. The graphical tools and interface provided to the text, graphics and sound database are presented. The design and functionality of alphabetical and topical indexes, multimedia tours, timelines and animated maps are detailed. Future directions for development are indicated.

	abstract = {Even in an age of self-publishing, we rarely think to equate publishers with authors. However, the Hogarth Press that Leonard and Virginia Woolf set up in the basement of their Richmond home was to become one of the most exciting enterprises in publishing history, bringing together the writing, editing, printing, and design of some of the most innovative books of the first half of the 20th century. This article begins by tracing the growth of the press from a small husband-wife project into the quirky publishing house that was to publish the likes of T. S. Eliot, Katherine Mansfield, and Sigmund Freud. It then looks at Virginia's role at the press and argues that her experience of setting type and being exposed to works such as Eliot's The Wasteland gave her a fresh outlook on her own writing and pushed her to experiment further with form. The paper also proposes that the Hogarth Press gave Woolf the best of all worlds: she not only got to publish her own writing, but was also involved in editing, proofing, and physically setting the type for her own work, and was able to take decisions about paratextual material. This was a remarkably rare experience for any author at the time - least of all a woman - and played an important part in the shaping of Woolf's aesthetic as a whole.},

These neurons were later optically reactivated during fear conditioning in a different context. The DG experimental group showed increased freezing in the original context, in which a foot shock was never delivered. The recall of this false memory was context-specific, activated similar downstream regions engaged during natural fear memory recall, and was also capable of driving an active fear response.
